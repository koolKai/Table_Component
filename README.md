# Table_Component
Here I'm trying to Design and implement a reusable Table component library using Vanilla JavaScript.

=>Features
-The table is reusable for any type of data.
-The component have a simple and flexible enough api.
-The table component is easy to extend for any use case a html table can be used.
-Columns are resizable.
-Support for a large number of rows.
-Cells are editable.

-Buttons Styling//https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_buttons.asp.
-Column Resizing//https://htmldom.dev.
-Resizing can also be done with css property "resize:both;".
